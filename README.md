# Author Gender Identification Project
## Project Description
Names can be spelled in various ways, making sound-based matching a more effective method for certain tasks (e.g., distinguishing between "Marc" and "Mark" or "Elizabeth" and "Elisabeth"). In this project, the Python package Fuzzy will be employed to determine the genders of authors who have appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture books.

The project unfolds in several steps. Initially, fuzzy (sound) name matching will be used to search for author names in a dataset provided by the US Social Security Administration. This dataset contains names and genders of individuals who have applied for Social Security Cards. Following this, the author dataset will be aggregated to include gender information. Finally, the new dataset will be utilized to plot the gender distribution of authors of children's picture books over time.

# Prerequisites
Proficiency in working with pandas DataFrames.
Basic understanding of NumPy for statistical operations.
Familiarity with Matplotlib for data visualization.

# Getting Started
Dataset Retrieval: Obtain the datasets provided by the US Social Security Administration and the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture books.
Environment Setup: Ensure Python is installed, and install the required packages using the provided requirements file.
Code Implementation: Follow the step-by-step instructions to perform fuzzy name matching, integrate gender information, and analyze the data.
Plotting Results: Utilize Matplotlib to create visualizations depicting the gender distribution trends among authors of children's picture books.
